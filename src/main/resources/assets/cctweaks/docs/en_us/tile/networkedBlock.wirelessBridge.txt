Now you're talking! The ${**}Wireless Bridge${**} allows you
to bind multiple wired networks together across infinite distances,
even spanning worlds.

Firstly place your bridge on a cable, then you'll need to get a
${**}Data Card${**} to bind two bridges together, but make sure
they're both chunk-loaded.

You can also bind these similarly to wireless modems. Use the
${dark_gray}openRemote${none} and ${dark_gray}closeRemote${none} methods
to do so.

These devices also work on turtles (and sometimes pocket computers),
though you must use the ${dark_gray}bindFromCard${none} method.

It is a matter of some debate how these work, some say it is ${*}quantum${*},
others say ${*}magic${*}. It works
